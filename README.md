## 🐶 Dog Years Converter

This project is a JavaScript program that calculates your age in dog years. Since dogs mature faster than humans, their first two years count as 10.5 dog years each, while every year after counts as 4 dog years.

🔑 Features
	•	Converts human age → dog years
	•	Handles the difference between early years (first 2 years) and later years
	•	Calculates the total dog years accurately
	•	Stores and formats your name in lowercase for cleaner output
	•	Outputs a personalized message using template literals

🧑‍💻 What I Learned
	•	Using variables (const vs let) in JavaScript
	•	Performing arithmetic operations with order of operations
	•	String manipulation with .toLowerCase()
	•	Practicing template literals for dynamic strings
	•	Writing readable, step-by-step code

Convert your human age into dog years with a fun JavaScript program 🐕
